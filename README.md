Data on banned books in the United States

The data from the PEN report on school book bans (see https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/), filtered to include only those banned in school libraries, and deduplicated so there is only one entry per title. The list contains 415 titles.
